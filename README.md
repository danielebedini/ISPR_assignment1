# ISPR - Assignment 4 os Signal Processing

Track of the assignment:
The musical pitch of a note is determined by its fundamental frequency. The pitch played by different instruments sounds different due to harmonics, i.e. other frequencies that are superimposed and determine the timbre of the instrument. 

This dataset contains samples from several instruments playing different notes. 

Plot the spectrogram for some of them (4 instruments are sufficient) and check if it is possible to recognize the different instruments by only looking at the spectrogram. 

In your presentation, discuss which samples you chose to compare, how you computed the spectrogram and whether the resulting features are sufficient to recognize the instrument.

In Python you can import WAVs (and acces several other music-related functions), using the LibROSA library.

##How to run: 

Activate python environment
```
conda activate [YOUR_ENV]
```
From the main file
```
python main.py
```
